## ABOUT ME 
I am a maths major specializing in computational maths, graduating in 2022.
My aim is to apply this specialty to Data Science and the Financial Markets. In addition,
my future goal is to work as a Quant Developer.

I chose **Data Science** as a career because I was interested in modeling complex
systems: social, economic, biological, financial, etc. So I paid for and enrolled in Andrew Ng's *Stanford*
Machine Learning Certification program, where I learned how to implement supervised and unsupervised machine learning
algorithms, such as linear regression, logistic regression and nueral networks, as well as anomaly detection.
The course was interesting and revealed how essential mathematics was in this field. However, I wanted to know
if there was a relation between Data Science and Machine Learning. I later discovered the Data Science
pipeline and how to implement it through the *Johns Hopkins University* Data Science Certification program.
Through this program, I also discovered that Machine Learning was part of the pipeline, refered
to as Predictive Analysis. During my free time, I participated in a volunteer program created by *NASA*
called Disk Detective that involved analysing and classifying celestial objects to help scientists
better understand planetary formation. Also, I interned as a Sector Analyst for the Davis
Investment Group where I was assigned to keep track of certain stocks held by the firm. Paying close attention
to news surrounding key economic sectors, and how they affected each other, was essential. In addition, I recently
participated in a computer science competition called **PicoCTF** sponsored by *Carnegie Mellon University*.
The competition was a great way for me to improve my programming and network security skills.
